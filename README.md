## Description Of Lab-5 Exercise Part 1
    The code first asks the user for the their name and sets it to the variable "name"
    Then the code asks the user using the variable "name" for their favorite color and sets it to "fav_color"
    Then the code insults your color as it pulls both "name" and "fav_color"
## How To Install This Code
    Once you are at my github repository, or MrPotential03's github repository, head to the repository titled Exercise-5.
    Once you have gone to that specific repository, type in the code "git clone https://github.com/MrPotential03/Exercise-5" in a terminal.
    This will clone the code I have in my repository into your computers local files.
## How To Use This Code
    Make sure you have a user to actually respond to the program when executed in its original form.
    To use it, first clone it(git clone [insert repository link]) into your repository, and then go to the file Lab-5 Exercise Part 1.ipynb(you can rename it if you'd like), and run the code in that file. There you can change it to your liking.
    Jupyter Lab, the website we are using to make adjustments to our code can be run over Chrome, FireFox, or Safari. Some other web browsers may support this, but that is something the contributor will have to test for themselves
