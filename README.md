## Description Of Lab-5 Exercise Part 1
1. The code first asks the user for the their name and sets it to the variable "name".
2. Then the code asks the user using the variable "name" for their favorite color and sets it to "fav_color".
3. Then the code insults your color as it pulls both "name" and "fav_color".
