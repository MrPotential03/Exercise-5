## License Choice ##

I was stuck between choosing the [Academic Free License](https://opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0) and the [Artistic License](https://opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license-2.0) for our program. Both are similar in their in features, but the Artistic License is more limited and comes with a lot more restrictions than the Academic Free License. One feature that I found really intersting was the Patent grant feature which is described as: "protection of licensees from patent claims made by code contributors regarding their contribution, and protection of contributors from patent claims made by licensees" ([Comparison of free and open-source software licences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licences#General_comparison)). The Academic Free License has this feature, but the Artistic License does not which suprised me because one would think that an "artistic" license would protect the original artist from bogus patent claims. Ultimately, I chose the Academic Free License because it is the best fit for our *academic* setting. It allows our code to be modified, distributed, used privately, and relicensed which is everything we are okay with happening to our three lines of Python.
